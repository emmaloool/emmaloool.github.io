        <div class="section">Character Arcs
            <div class="label"><br> Birthed</div>
            <p>
                I was born and raised in the northwest suburbs of Chicago, and I'm Taiwanese-American.
                (I can understand Mandarin, but prefer not to pain people with my bad pronunciation.)
            </p>

            <div class="label"><br>High School</div>
            <p>
                I went to William Fremd High School and graduated as an Academic Scholar.
                I played cello from third grade to senior year, and was section leader at my school and local youth orchestras.
                I also participated in Model United Nations and Math Team.<br><br>
                After getting bullied by some bros in my AP CS class, I decided to join Girls Who Code. 
                I did their Summer Immersion Program (thanks GE!), started a Girls Who Code club at my school, and TAed for the SIP program before my senior year.
                These experiences solidified my resolve to study computer science and address diversity challenges in computing.

            <div class="label"><br>Keeping Up with the Times</div>
            <p>
                Nowadays, I'm most interested in learning about challenges URM students face in computing, and being an ally.<br>
                I'm also interested in improving accessibility at the School of Computer Science.<br><br>

                Outside of academics, I follow dialogue about representation, ownership, and compensation for BIPOC in the food industry.
                Similarly, I'm interested in learning more about the same and also sustainability in the fashion industry.<br><br>
                During quarantine, I've contemplated my role as an Asian-American in the context of the Black Lives Matter movement, and am educating myself on being actively anti-racist. Unequivocally: Black Lives Matter. <br><br>

                If you have any resources/conversations you'd like to share/have, please contact me!<br>
            </p>

            <div class="label"><br> Food</div>
            <p>
                I cook and bake a lot, thanks to my mom teaching me as a kid. She would make and give away Western-style cakes and cookies. 
                I primarily helped her make pineapple cakes (鳳梨酥) and bread buns.
                Since I've left for college, I'm trying to trace back her old recipes or recreate them from memory, with fair success.
                One day, I hope to open a café in honor of her.<br><br>

                I'm particularly enamored with food science, and considered studying that instead of/in conjunction with CS.
                Since Carnegie Mellon doesn't have a food science program, for now, I'm an armchair cooking student. 
                These days I like to learn about French-inspired Japanese pastry techniques, Taiwanese-American fusion food, and fermentation.<br><br>
                
                As a student, I don't usually have time to make anything fancy, and I have to meal prep.
                But when I can, I like to bake bread and Taiwanese street food for friends.
                Recently (re: quarantine), I've gotten accustomed to using enamel & cast-iron skillets and making my own cold brew.<br><br>

                Eventually I want to gain some training in food styling and photography, and set up a blog to display my progress. <br>
            </p>

            <div class="label"><br> Music</div>
            <p>
                I defer to Mitski and Talking Heads for casual listening.<br> 
                "You May Find Yourself"... watching me loop Nobody at 2AM.
                I also fluctuate between Kero Kero Bonito, Run the Jewels, Japanese Breakfast, Chloe x Halle, Beyonce, Bleachers, Tyler the Creator, Death Grips, Caroline Polanchek, Flo Milli, The Regrettes, and more.
            </p>

            <div class="label"><br> Memes</div>
            <p>
                I spend a good amount of time cultivating and deploying reaction images/memes.
                Thematically, I really enjoy cursed cat images (few examples are scattered around this site),
                as well as frogs and Animal Crossing.<br><br>
                I also make my own memes - I'll post a portfolio of some of my best work soon.
                I've gotten pretty good at quickly cropping out backgrounds to make transparent icons; I use them as reacts on my Slack workspaces. 
                I consider myself an expert in macOS Preview’s Lasso cropping tools, and I frequently used Pixlr. <br>
